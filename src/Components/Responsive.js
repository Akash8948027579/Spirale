        <Typography>Arvind Kejriwal Skips 3rd Summons, AAP Says Probe Agency Notice Illegal

New Delhi: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal won't appear for questioning today in Delhi liquor policy case, the Aam Aadmi Partry said. AAP said that the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate were illegal and the only aim is to arrest Mr Kejriwal.
This was the third notice to Mr Kejriwal, also the AAP's national convenor, after he refused to appear before the probe agency on two earlier summons for November 2 and December 21.

The Aam Aadmi Party asserted that Mr Kejriwal was ready to cooperate with the agency but claimed that the summons was sent with the intention of arresting him.

"Why has the notice been sent right before elections? The notice is an attempt to stop Kejriwal from campaigning in elections," the party alleged.

The AAP chief had been questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the case in April, but had not been made an accused by the agency.</Typography>
